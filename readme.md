# alfiot.net

This repo contains the files for the main part of my webpage, [alfiot.net](https://alfiot.net).
It features automatic age insertion and an "enlightened mode" that removes most of the webpage's
styling (because the truly enlightened know the web should still look like this).

The website uses [Xenon](https://github.com/p2js/xenon) components to represent the projects on the page more concisely.

It has partial support for noJS, using my birth year instead of automatic insertion, displaying a fallback styling for projects, and not displaying the enlightenment button.
