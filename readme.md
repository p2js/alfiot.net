# alfiot.net

This repo contains the files for the main part of my webpage, [alfiot.net](https://alfiot.net).
It features automatic age insertion and an "enlightened mode" that removes most of the webpage's
styling (because the truly enlightened know the web should still look like this). It also has full
support for noJS, using my birth year instead of automatic insertion and not displaying the
enlightenment button.
